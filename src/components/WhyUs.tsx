          <h2>Our vision: Advancing therapeutic options for patients in small and neglected indications</h2>
          <h3>The opportunity: explosion of novel medications already on market and coming to market, targeting cancer and other diseases much more specifically (“precision medicine”)</h3>
          <p>
            Progress in cancer research has dramatically accelerated over the last few years. Most of this innovation comes from US biotechs (3x as many patent registrations for new medicines as in Europe) and Chinese biotechs (9x as many patents for new medicines as Europe), which are at least initially primarily focused on the US market (49% of global pharma market). For biotechs, the European market is typically perceived as a complicated collection of 30+ different healthcare systems, with unfavorable reimbursement conditions and complex market access pathways. For large pharmaceutical companies, these small niche drugs are seen as a distraction away from blockbuster drugs with 100s of millions of revenues, even in the EU alone. Often, these drugs are either not even launched in the EU at all, or only in select markets, even though with 24% the EU represents an important share of the global pharma market. As a result, many biotech assets are not being marketed in Europe despite significant medical benefit for patients and communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, this also applies to already marketed drugs: “Big Pharma” companies must focus efforts, resources, and management attention on their largest blockbusters at the cost of smaller, already marketed drugs. This leads to very good drugs not being commercialized to their full economic and medical potential and leaves value uncaptured.
          </p>
          <h3>The challenge: lack of an efficient commercialization model and a perception that available licensing partners in EU may expose drugs to risks that would spill back into the US market and other products</h3>
          <p>
            For most innovators the main market is the US. While they often do not have the capabilities or the bandwidth to cover EU markets, they are also very hesitant to out-license these products to a local partner who is not perceived to be at par with “US Big Pharma standards”, for instance because of inexperienced management, lack of track record, questionable medical function, or shortcomings in supply chain operations. Therefore, to minimize risks, drugs are often kept in-house, even though most stakeholders would agree there to be an upside for both patients and the business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, there have been examples of unethical behavior across the EU with multiple smaller “tail end” or “specialty pharma” companies, from aggressive price increases, to disrupted supply chains, from questionable marketing practices to unethical data creation, and many others.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the “old school pharma model” is often not suited to serve these small patient populations and their caregivers appropriately. As these patient populations become increasingly clinically diverse across cancer types and treatment lines, the “one-size-fits all” model very often fails to provide patients with the adequate solution precisely needed at their stage of the disease journey.
          </p>
          <h3>The solution: a novel, hybrid quality player combining “Big Pharma” experienced leaders with a long track-record of successful outcomes and high-quality behavior in perceived-to-be risky fields together with a “digital first” operating model leveraging the latest approaches in technology and experienced tech talent</h3>
          <p>
            Critical functions and capabilities are required to provide licensors with comfort that there are no unnecessary risks: supply chain, PV, Quality/Safety, Regulatory, Medical, Finance/Tax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indicators of “sufficient reliability and quality” for licensors are needed: team members who have seen how Big Pharma operates, who have many years of experience in the above-mentioned functions, and who have a track record of providing these services at industry leading standards, or a track record of taking on products from global pharmaceutical companies without flaws.
          </p>
          <p>
            A “digital first” approach that enables serving small patient and HCP populations, and to drive efficiencies across key functions, e.g.:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc'>
            <li className='ml-5'>Highly digitized customer journeys and ML-based steering of commercial activities increase effectiveness of commercial model, and reduce need for extensive physical footprint</li>
            <li className='ml-5'>Data generation with medical community allow for better clinical decision making and reimbursement</li>
            <li className='ml-5'>Technology-enabled supply chains and distribution increase reliability, e.g., prediction of stock- out risks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            NewCo Biopharma is a novel type of Biopharma player that has all these elements under one roof. The company has 180+ years of combined “Big Pharma” experience and track record, its BoD/ ExCo members have seamlessly transferred products over without supply chain disruptions, have had USD Bns of P&amp;L responsibility, and knows how “Big Pharma” / biotech “ticks”. Additionally, the team comprises leaders who successfully digitized pharma companies and other parts of healthcare, and who have demonstrated the ability to develop and leverage novel technologies to the benefit of patients, HCPs/caregivers, and products.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this combination NewCo Biopharma will lead the way to a novel pharma model that will allow to fulfil the vision of “precision medicine”, will make niche medications available to small and neglected patient populations starting in oncology and expanding to other specialty therapeutic areas, and will eventually serve as the blueprint for a new generation of biopharmaceutical companies paving the way to “individualized care”.
